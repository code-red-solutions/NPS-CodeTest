I'm a back-end guy... Through and through. Apart from a brief stint for a 4 week contract that was pure JavaScript, I haven't touched front-end since 2001!

Ok, so a lot has changed in front-end in the last 5 or 6 years, but I've just never had the opportunity to upskill, even if I've previously recognised that it's an area I need to know more about in order to stay sharp in my industry.

As far as I had gotten to date was to research what I would choose to put into a modern-day front-end tech stack but I hadn't picked up the tools and tried it 'in anger'.

My entire staring context for this project was that I knew next to nothing about modern front-end development but that if I were to choose a front-end stack it would probably be an app based on Angular 2+ and Redux for state management. I was also kind of interested in this thing called 'TypeScript' to provide a more familiar style of programming and, obviously, type-safety. Dynamic languages certainly have their pro's but I like a tighter programming style than pure JavaScript allows sometimes...

Hence I decided to use this code test as an opportunity to learn modern-day front-end development and tech stacks from scratch and to treat this as a learning excercise and a 'real' project. The Code Red NPS Widget is the result, and this website is my attempt to document not only the product, but also my learnings and experiences that I can leverage into the future.
