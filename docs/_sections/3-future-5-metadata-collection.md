As a lower priority, we'd like to add the version number of the widget release as an internal property of the widget and include the collection of metadata along with the feedback submission. This metadata should be submitted with the feedback details and include:

- The widget release version
- The widget name
- URL of the host page
- The config that was specified by the host page
- Date of submission
- History of the user's interaction with the widget (i.e. open, close, change of rating selection etc).
