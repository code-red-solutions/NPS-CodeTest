There's some things not quite right with the UX of the widget...

### Browser Rendering of Feedback Form

Firstly, there's a technical issue with the way that the feedback form is displayed in non-Chrome browsers. We've sought assistance from the makers of the core UI elements we're using, but it might take a little while to solve.

### Submission Process UX

We also don't quite like the UX of the current feedback form submission process. Once the user click the submission button the form disappears. If the user is quick enough they can click the widget and the popup will say that the submission is processing. And after the form has been submitted it will change the popup to say it's been submitted but once again the user needs to click the widget to see the popup.

More time is needed to consider how to better visualise this process for the user.
