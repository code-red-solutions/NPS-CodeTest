### Front-end

Unit testing in the front-end runs on Node within the develoment server. It uses `ts-node` as a compilation engine, Mocha as a test runner, Chai for assertions extensions and TypeMoq as a JavaScript mocking library.

### Back-end

Unit testing in the back-end runs within Visual Studio on the development server. It can use any standard test runner that works within Visual Studio, such as Visual Studio itself, or a relevant pluggin such as the ReSharper test runner. It uses the 'Should' library for assertion extensions and Moq as a mocking libary.

### More Information
