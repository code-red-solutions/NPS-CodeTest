The NPS Widget has a number of features to allow you to get the most from your Customer Satisfaction survey and whilst allowing you include it seamlessly into your site.

### Positioning
<br/>
You can poition the widget in any corner of your site whilst also specifying corresponding distances from each edge.

Throughout this site you'll see these effects as we've changed the widget on different pages, sometimes subtly.

### Styling
<br/>
You can style the widget with any colours you want so that it feels like a natural part of your website. This includes the ability to change the active colours of the widget, i.e. rollovers or the elements your users interact with.

### Questions and user responses
<br/>
The most important aspect of the NPS widget is the questions you ask of your customers. You can add an introduction to the feedback form, specifiy the text of the NPS question and even change the scale of the rating. It doesn't have to be the standard 0 - 10 rating system that most NPS widgets use.

Lastly you can specify what optional comments you'd like from your users. Not only can you specify a question to ask your users when calling for extra comments, but you can provide any number of ranges within the rating scale where you can ask for a different comment (e,g, between 1-5 you can ask one question and 5-10 ask another).

### User Interacion Saved Across Browser Refreshes
<br/>
Isn't is annoying when something goes wrong and you loose all your data on the page by accidently refreshing the browser or navigating away from the page by mistake?

Your users won't suffer from this problem as the state of the widget is saved to the browser's local storage. This means that navigating away from the page or even hitting refresh won't loose any of your customers' interactions with the widget. It'll be in exactly the same state when they come back to it as it was when they left it.
